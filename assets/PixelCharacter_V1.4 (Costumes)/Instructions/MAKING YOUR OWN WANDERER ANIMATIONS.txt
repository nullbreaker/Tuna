PIXEL CHARACTER ANIMATIONS (VERSION 1.4)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello!

This notepad provides the steps to making your own Wanderer animations with the PNG files.

This pack was made using Aseprite and only Patrons are granted access to the aseprite file. If you do not own this software and/or are not a Patron then you are still on luck. I have exported every layer in order for you to be able to make your own regardless of the software or whether you are a Patron or not.

WANDERER ANIMATIONS WITH A SWORD AND SHIELD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open your editing software
2. Open the SHIELD folder then browse through the "1Wanderer_Atlas" folder and select the shield you desire. 
3. Go through the ARMOR (ignore AboveBow and Quiver), PANTS, SHIRT, WEAPONS (ignore Bow) folders and select "1Wanderer_Atlas" 
4. Choose the images you like and open the images.
5. Open the Base folder and open the PNG named "64x48_Base_Character". Copy and paste it over the SHIELDS
6. Copy the ARMOR SKIN that you selected and paste it on top.
7. Copy the PANTS and SHIRT (no order necessary) and paste it on top.
8. Copy the SWORD SKIN you chose and paste it on top of everything.
9. Now you have made your own gladiator that you can export.
